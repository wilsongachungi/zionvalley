                By coming together as a Harambee Village Community - Zion Valley is a living working example to
                demonstrate that land which is otherwise low value and providing little sustenance to its owners, can
                now be transformed into an income-generating project that serves the community, the environment, and all
                its Harambee members.
                <br>
                We shall also represent the community in providing solutions to such problems as the lack of a bridge.
